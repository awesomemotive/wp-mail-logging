 * Zero-configuration - just install and enjoy.

== Installation ==
Just install and activate wp-mail-logging. The plugin will do the work for you! You can list all logged mails on the plugin site.
I recommend the following plugins if you want to send mails via SMTP because they are technically well integrated into WordPress and provide error messages on failure.:
- [WP Mail SMTP](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/)
- [SMTP Mailer](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/smtp-mailer/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I know the mail was sent? =
If there is no error logged chances are high the mail was sent. There are plugins that overwrite (do not customize) the default mailing mechanism of WordPress - they maybe do not inform about failure so it can't be logged by WP Mail Logging.
= How do I know the wail was delivered? =
The logged email has been sent by WordPress but please note this does NOT mean it has been delivered. With the given functionality of WordPress you can't determine if a mail was delivered successfully.
